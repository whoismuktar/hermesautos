              to you on non-Hermes Autos websites and mobile apps on your
              current device or on other devices you use. For information about

                  to the specific browser or device from which you opt out, and
                  therefore you will need to opt out separately on all of your
                  browsers and devices. If you delete or reset your cookies or
                  mobile advertising identifiers, change browsers (including
                  upgrading certain browsers), or use a different device, any
                  opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will need to
                  opt out again. If you choose to opt out, you will still see
                  advertisements while browsing online, however the
                  advertisements may be less relevant to you and your interests.
